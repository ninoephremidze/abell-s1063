NFW perturber fits with a varying redshift for the perturber. Uses multi-plane lensing and correctly projects 
the position of the perturber even if it is a background interloper (in the "calculating projection" section).

Jupyter notebooks display the results. The f115w and f150w filters find a background interloper (z=0.5). The f200w 
filter finds a redshift consistent with lens redshift of z_lens = 0.348.
