Fits with a co-centered sersic light profile for a perturber. Adds two additional non-linear parameters: half-light radius, R_sers and 
sersic index, n. Solves for sersic light amplitude by matrix inversion (together with shapelet coefficients).

I do not find any clearly sersic-type profile from the perturber that seems to benefit the fit.
