CAB + NFW perturber fits using 1 shapelet basis for different filters.

Priors already enforce:
- the correct parity: the parity of the second image is flipped.
- the optimal orientation: the curvature must be added along the long axis, 
  which I have found results in lower BIC.
- narrow perturber position region.

Results:
Consistent perturber parameters from f115w and f200w, very high concentration
(that always hits a prior) from f150w.
