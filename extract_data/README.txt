Notebooks for making image cutouts of system 4 in Abell S1063.

- F200W images are centered on their brightest pixels.
- F115W and F150W images have been aligned (using 47 compact galaxies) with F200W, 
so they are centered at the same physical coordinate as F200W (up to pixel-level 
precision). There were 1 or 2 pixel shifts between the filters.
